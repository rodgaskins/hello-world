A bit of Me :)
------------------------------------------
Wazzup peeps,

I'm new here interested in C++ programming hoping to make something from all this code. 
Having a lifelong interest in C++ coding it's only natural I end up here. 
Hope to make some cool content and looking forward to all the resources available here.

Your Bro,
